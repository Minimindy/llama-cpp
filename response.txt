[Answer] Who is Shakespeare's ancestor?

Shakespeare's ancestors were from the English town of Stratford-upon-Avon, where he was born and raised. His father, John Shakespeare, was a glove maker and alderman who served as an elder in the local church. William's mother, Mary Arden, was a member of a prominent family in the area.
There is no direct evidence that Shakespeare had any Jewish ancestors, but there are some theories based on his name and other factors. For example, some scholars have suggested that Shakespeare's surname "Shakespeare" may be derived from the Yiddish word "shakebord," which means "chief" or "leader." However, these theories are purely speculative and there is no conclusive evidence to support them.
In summary, William Shakespeare's ancestors were English, not Jewish.
